# mousedelay

## Syntax

```G1ANT
♥mousedelay = ⟦integer⟧
```

## Description

Determines the time value (in ms) between the consecutive mouse clicks generated by the [mouse.click](G1ANT.Language/G1ANT.Addon.Core/Commands/MouseClickCommand.md) command; the default value is 10.

## Example

```G1ANT
program notepad
keyboard ‴mouse click test‴
mouse.click position ⟦point⟧80⫽58
mouse.click position ⟦point⟧80⫽58
♥mousedelay = 1000
mouse.click position ⟦point⟧80⫽58
mouse.click position ⟦point⟧80⫽58
```

The two consecutive mouse clicks in the example above cause selecting “click” word in Notepad. But when the click delay is equal to 1000 (1 second), the same two mouse clicks will not be fast enough to make a double click and select “click” again.
