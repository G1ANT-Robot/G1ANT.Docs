# sql

## Syntax

```G1ANT
sql query ⟦text⟧
```

## Description

This command executes an SQL query while user is connected to their database. Please use the [`database`](DatabaseCommand.md) command first to establish a connection to a database. The query results are returned as a list of dictionaries, from which you can fetch individual records.

## Example

In this example, after a connection to a database is established with the `database` command (remember to provide real information in the connection string), an sql query for `name` and `surname` columns in the `users` table is performed and the resulting dictionary is stored in the default `♥result` variable. Then, the first row in the dictionary is assigned to the `♥row` variable and the values from its `name` and `surname` indexes are assigned to the `♥name` and `♥surname` variables, respectively. Finally, the information from the first record is displayed in a dialog box:

```G1ANT
database ‴Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;
Password=myPassword;‴
sql ‴select name, surname from users‴
♥row = ♥result⟦1⟧
♥name = ♥row⟦name⟧
♥surname = ♥row⟦surname⟧
dialog ‴Name: ♥name, Surname: ♥surname‴
```
