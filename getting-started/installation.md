# Installation

To get a free Developer license of the program, register on our [website](http://platform.g1ant.com). You will then be provided with a link to the file download webpage \(after receiving email\), where you can choose from the standalone EXE or Windows MSI Installer file, either in a full or lite version \(with or without add-ons\).

To run the program on a system start-up, paste the shortcut to the executable file in the Windows Startup folder.

To navigate to Windows Startup folder: Hold down the Windows key and press R. Type: shell:startup. Click OK.

Now G1ANT.Robot is set to initialize automatically on a system start-up. When G1ANT.Robot is running in the background, press Ctrl+G to choose a selected process or click on the G icon in the system tray to bring the robot window to the foreground.
